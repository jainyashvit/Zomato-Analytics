Zomato Analysis Project

This project focuses on performing an in-depth Zomato data analysis to derive insights into customer behavior, restaurant performance, and market trends. The objective was to use data analytics and visualization tools to uncover patterns that can help businesses improve decision-making in the food delivery and dining sector.

The project integrates multiple tools for comprehensive exploration and reporting:

Excel was used for initial data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory analysis to ensure structured and reliable datasets.

SQL played a key role in querying and filtering large datasets, extracting important metrics such as top cuisines, high-performing restaurants, and order frequency.

Power BI was applied to build interactive dashboards focusing on customer ratings, order trends, cuisine preferences, delivery performance, and sales growth patterns. These visualizations provide clear insights into customer behavior and restaurant dynamics.

Tableau was leveraged for advanced visualization, storytelling, and comparative analysis across different dimensions like city-level trends, cost distribution, and customer satisfaction.

The analysis focused on identifying:

Customer Preferences – cuisine choices, order frequency, and ratings distribution.

Restaurant Performance – sales patterns, delivery efficiency, and high/low-performing outlets.

Market Insights – emerging trends, competitive analysis, and regional differences.

Key findings highlight how customer ratings influence restaurant visibility, the importance of delivery efficiency in driving customer loyalty, and how cuisine diversity affects business growth.

Overall, this project demonstrates the use of Excel, SQL, Power BI, and Tableau to transform raw food delivery data into actionable business intelligence. It not only provides valuable insights for restaurant owners and food delivery platforms but also showcases the power of analytics in the fast-growing food-tech industry.
